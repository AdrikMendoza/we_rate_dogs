    "### Issue #1: Replaced values. rating_numerator has wild rating numerators and might be replaced with 10. \n",
    "> There is no definitive rule by WeRateDogs to not accept wild rating numerators. In this context, the best alternative is to change the wild rating numerators by the max rating which is 10 points.\n",
    "### Issue #2: Replaced values. rating_denominator the rating denominator is 10. \n",
    "> The rating denominator by WerateDogs has a value of 10 points by default and we proceeded to replace under rated denominators by a value of 10.\n",
    "### Issue #3: Extracted the correct value for source column. \n",
    "> The source column had a lot of text and was not so much understandable. We proceeded to extract the correct text for this column.\n",
    "### Issue #4: Removed Retweets.\n",
    "> We can consider retweets as duplicates. So we removed the retweets rows. \n",
    "### Issue #5: Dropped unnecessary columns. Missing values in these columns: in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp, expanded_urls.\n",
    "> These columns had a lot of nulls. The best alternative was removing them because they were not relevant for the analysis.\n",
    "### Issue #6: Changed the timestamp column to datetime type. \n",
    "> We've changed the right data type for the column called timestamp. \n",
    "### Issue #7: Changed the 'None' value in name column for null values.\n",
    "> All 'None' text values were changed by null values. \n",
    "### Issue #8: Changed text in p1, p2, and p3 columns.\n",
    "> All these column has some grammatical errors. We proceeded to fix this.\n",
    "### Issue #9: Created a Dog stage column where should be a single column rather than four: doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo.  \n",
    "> The new column called stage was created in order to contain the extracted text in doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo columns.\n",
    "### Issue #10: Merged all dataframes as twitter_archive_master.  \n",
    "> The observational unit, tweets, is spread across three different datasets. So, these datasets should be merged as they are part of the same observational unit."
